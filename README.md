# PaceConverter

This project is my first try at angular, so please be kind with my rookie mistakes.

This is an attempt at a progressive web app to easily convert from pace to speed, useful for taking up running or trail and adapt to the common min:sec/km unit of measurement used by the runners & trailers.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

A live version is available at `https://paceonverter.io` curtesy of github-pages.
(Sometime I fail to setup the custom domain, so you could try `https://toxic0berliner.github.io/paceConverter/` or maybe `https://paceconverter.io` if I got around to purchasing the correct domain...)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

I'm not a (real)developper, so I didn't get to write any tests... Guess I'm maybe not that different to real devs on that account...
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
